        <h2>How do I work?</h2>
        <p>
          The difference between psychotherapy and spiritual guidance is that I don't try to analyse you with my brain, but rather I perceive information from beyond.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          This way I'm able to feel your energy, life and history even before the conversation starts and more and more so as the conversation progresses. By the end of the first session I have a clear idea about where you are at in life and whether/how I can help you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mind you, this is not a cheap trick to skip acreditation in psychotherapy and just dive in and reap the benefits without any real effort â€” far from it. Perceiving information from the subtle world is something that takes time and skill to develop, not to mention I have to take very good care of myself, in order to be able to stay connected to the Truth.
        </p>

        <h2>How does my session look like?</h2>
        <p>
          We meet up in a cafÃ©, park or wherever and we talk. Simple as that. You don't need to prepare, just book a session, show up and let me take care of the rest.
        </p>

              Jakub is well-prepared and above all very human in his approach. He puts attention to the client first.

              Before getting to know Jakub, I was nervous and stressed carrying so many issues from my daily life, but after receiving my session I felt really different: so relaxed and calm.

              Jakub is an excelent healer, very much recommended!

              Initially I was sceptical, but after I got to know Jakub, I decided to give it a go. He explained to me I need to connect more with nature (note: and life itself, to compensate underdevelopped 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> chakra) and not to only live in my head, amongst other things. His words really resonated with me and as I started to live by them, I started to feel better in my body, with less headaches and I felt my spine released a lot of tension, making me feel more relaxed. I highly recommend Jakub's therapy, both the therapy itself which was very powerful and quite frankly made me astonished as I wasn't aware previously how strong energy really is, as well as listening to his words, his message might be simple, but it's very powerful and efficient nonetheless.

              I felt like a huge release of energy from my shoulders, and shortly after I started crying for no specific reason. It was very strong and very liberating. Just thought I'd share this with you.
