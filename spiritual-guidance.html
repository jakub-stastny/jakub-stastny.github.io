      <h1>Spiritual guidance</h1>

      <p>
        The difference between psychotherapy and spiritual guidance is that I don't try to analyse you with my brain, but rather I perceive information from beyond.

      <p>
        Mind you, this is not a cheap trick to skip studying and just dive in and reap the benefits without any real effort, far from it. Perceiving information from beyond is something that takes time and skill to develop. Besides I'm well versed in psychology literature, which I've been reading since the age of 9 and to this day.
