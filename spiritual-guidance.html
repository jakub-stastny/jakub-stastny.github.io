          I believe everyone can heal. I believe everyone's life can be beautiful, fulfilling and just worth living. No matter how hurt, lonely or empty you may be feeling at the moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          My life felt like an uphill battle. I used to suffer from anxiety, heavy depression, toxic relationships and even flirted with suicide for way too long.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have you ever looked into the eyes of an old, wise person and felt like despite their age and deteriorating health they were in a place of total bliss, inner peace and strength? Would you like to be that person? You don't have to wait till your late age to be exactly that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't get me wrong — I'm not promising you a rose garden. There are many challenges, breakups and death in life. The question is do you want to suffer more than you have to or do you want to be strong and calm and endure the storm, knowing and understanding deep inside you the natural order of things, the understanding that brings you eternal strength and peace.
        </p>

        <p>
          The choice is yours. I've made mine. And when I did, the beauty, depth and peace I started to be completely surrounded by just made me so awstruck and humbled, that I decided to dedicate my life to helping people to experience it themselves. Not on my terms or through my ideas, but through theirs. To do my part in bringing into existence the future I always wished for the humanity and the Earth.
        </p>

        <p class="welcome">
          I cannot heal you, but I can be there with you, shine light on your path and teach you to be your own healer. Welcome to my site 🙏🏼

        <h2>How do I work?</h2>
        <p>
          The difference between psychotherapy and spiritual guidance is that I don't try to analyse you with my brain, but rather I perceive information from beyond.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          This way I'm able to feel your energy, life and history even before the conversation starts and more and more so as the conversation progresses. By the end of the first session I have a clear idea about where you are at in life and whether/how I can help you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mind you, this is not a cheap trick to skip acreditation in psychotherapy and just dive in and reap the benefits without any real effort — far from it. Perceiving information from the subtle world is something that takes time and skill to develop, not to mention I have to take very good care of myself, in order to be able to stay connected to the Truth.
        </p>

        <h2>How does my session look like?</h2>
        <p>
          We meet up in a café, park or wherever and we talk. Simple as that. You don't need to prepare, just book a session, show up and let me take care of the rest.
