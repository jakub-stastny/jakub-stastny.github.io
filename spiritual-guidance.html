        <p>
          The difference between psychotherapy and spiritual guidance is that I don't try to analyse you with my brain, but rather I perceive information from beyond.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          This way I'm able to perceive your energy, life and history even before the conversation starts and more and more so as the conversation progresses. By the end of the first session I have a clear idea about where you are at in life and whether/how I can help you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mind you, this is not a cheap trick to skip acreditation in psychotherapy and just dive in and reap the benefits without any real effort â€” far from it. Perceiving information from beyond is something that takes time and skill to develop. And there's always price to pay in life and the cost of developing these sensibilities is often high, it certainly was in my case.
        </p>

        <p style="font-style: italic">
          I cannot heal you, but I can be there with you, shine light on your path and teach you to be your own healer. This is my path.
        </p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          We meet up in a cafÃ©, park or wherever and we talk. Simple as that. You don't need to prepare, just <a href="/contact">book a session</a>, show up and let me take care of the rest.
