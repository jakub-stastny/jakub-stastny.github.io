      <h1>Spiritual guidance</h1>

      <p>
        The difference between psychotherapy and spiritual guidance is that I don't try to analyse you with my brain, but rather I perceive information from beyond.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This way I'm able to perceive your energy, life and history even before the conversation starts and more and more details as the conversation progresses. By the end of the first session I have a clear idea about where you are at in life and whether/how I can help you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mind you, this is not a cheap trick to skip acreditation and just dive in and reap the benefits without any real effort — far from it. Perceiving information from beyond is something that takes time and skill to develop. In many cases, mine included, it comes after serious life crisis, without which one wouldn't be able to work these skills, so there's always price to pay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides I'm well versed in psychology literature, which I've been reading since the age of 9 and to this day.
