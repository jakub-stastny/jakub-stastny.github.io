        Hi! My name is Jakub Šťastný and I'm a <a href="/spiritual-guidance">spiritual guide</a> and <a href="/energy-healing">energy healer</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        From my early age I knew the traditional path of life wasn't for me. I dropped out of secondary school, learnt programming and moved to London, starting a career in IT of nearly 15 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        After living in various places and learning multiple languages, I found myself called to Mexico, where I had my spiritual awakening, having premonitions that came true, seeing visions, being able to communicate telepathically with people alive and dead alike.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was confused and sought spiritual guidance. I met wonderful old lady called Marisela, who changed my life and helped me to navigate this strange new world.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started to learn working The Light and discovered my calling in life to be helping others with my guidance and healings, hoping to do for others what Marisela once did for me.
