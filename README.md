The first commit when I finally got how this should be done is `24871b80` from `Fri Feb 3 11:19:17 2023 -0600` from when I was in Emiliano Zapata, Morelos.


# Development

Run helper `serve` (defined in [.env/zsh.zsh]()).

# TODO

## Top-priority

- Am I going to be using GH pages? It seems like they send /dev and other repos to my CNAME domain as well, rather than just this one.
- Is there a babashka/Deno version of Python HTTP server? Custom server could do overrides like /page -> /page.html.

## Fixes

- Fix the back button.

## Design

- Draw a logo.
- Favicon(s) in various sizes.

## Promo

- Put into my Reddit profile.
