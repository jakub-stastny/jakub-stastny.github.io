# TODO

## Top-priority

- Am I going to be using GH pages? It seems like they send /dev and other repos to my CNAME domain as well, rather than just this one.
- Is there a babashka/Deno version of Python HTTP server? Custom server could do overrides like /page -> /page.html.

## Fixes

- Fix the back button.

## Design

- Draw a logo.
- Favicon(s) in various sizes.

## Promo

- Put into my Reddit profile.
