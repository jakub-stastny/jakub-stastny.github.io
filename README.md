Run helper `serve` (defined in [.env/zsh.zsh]()).

# TODO

## Top-priority

- Is there a babashka/Deno version of Python HTTP server? Custom server could do overrides like /page -> /page.html.
- Static page generator (possibly a custom one in babashka).

## Fixes

- Helpers: advertise helper functions from .env/zsh.zsh.
- HTML-encode my email.
- Fix the back button.

## Wiki

- Wiki for H4H, what's the path etc.

## Design

- Draw a logo.
- Favicon(s) in various sizes.

## Promo

- Put into my Reddit profile.

## Once I'm an OK astrologer

- Report template & start doing full chart readings (I might charge for these).
