# Template

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/layout.css" />
    <script type="module" src="/js/layout.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <main>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

# Development

Run helper `serve` (defined in [.env/zsh.zsh]()).

# TODO

## Top-priority

- Am I going to be using GH pages? It seems like they send /dev and other repos to my CNAME domain as well, rather than just this one.
- Is there a babashka/Deno version of Python HTTP server? Custom server could do overrides like /page -> /page.html.

## Features

- Google Analytics.
- Large screens: "links WHITESPACE content content WHITESPACE", too long text is hard to read.

## Design

- Hero image(s).
