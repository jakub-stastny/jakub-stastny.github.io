        <p>
          I believe everyone can heal. I believe everyone's life can be beautiful, fulfilling and just worth living. No matter how hurt, lonely or empty you may be feeling at the moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          My life felt like an uphill battle. I used to suffer from anxiety, heavy depression, toxic relationships and even flirted with suicide for way too long.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have you ever looked into the eyes of an old, wise person and felt like despite their age and deteriorating health they were in a place of total bliss, inner peace and strength? Would you like to be that person? You don't have to wait till your late age to be exactly that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't get me wrong — I'm not promising you a rose garden. There are many challenges, breakups and death in life. The question is do you want to suffer more than you have to or do you want to be strong and calm and endure the storm, knowing and understanding deep inside you the natural order of things, the understanding that brings you eternal strength and peace.
        </p>

        <p>
          The choice is yours. I've made mine. And when I did, the beauty, depth and peace I started to be completely surrounded by just made me so awstruck and humbled, that I decided to dedicate my life to helping people to experience it themselves. Not on my terms or through my ideas, but through theirs. To do my part in bringing into existence the future I always wished for the humanity and the Earth.

          I cannot heal you, but I can be there with you, shine light on your path and teach you to be your own healer. Welcome to my site 🙏🏼
        </p>

        <h2>How do I work?</h2>
        <p>
          Energy healing is a powerful way of healing emotional, mental, spiritual and physical issues. It can even detect physical diseases up to several months before they manifest in body, since the body manifests from our energy.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many methods of energy work. I don't subscribe to any one of them. Methods are just fancy marketing terms, you either learnt to work energy or you didn't, simple as that.
        </p>

        <p>
          My healing abilities come from life-long sensibility and awareness, growing up in the countryside among plants and animals, later moving to the big world, forgetting all about my sensibilities and being constantly depressed, up to finally crashing to the point of not being able to tolerate my existence anymore, reborning and opening myself spiritually and knowing things from the future, talking to dead souls etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          So no, I haven't gone to a 3 week retreat for rich kids to learn healing in an ivory tower, the resources I have come from me. I'm eternally grateful to my spiritually advanced friends to guide through this period of my life.
        </p>

        <h2>How does my session look like?</h2>
        <!-- Home/workplace visit is the proper term says Patricia. -->
        <p>
          After you <a href="/contact">book a session</a> and I answer any questions you might have, I come to your place. I will ask you to lie down on your bed, I put a blanket over you, on top of which I put healing crystals, depending on which chakras you need strenghtening.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I play relaxating music, while I cleanse and seal the space. After we're in a safe and protected environment, I'll start aligning your aura and your chakras.
        </p>

        <p>
          The whole treatment takes about 40 minutes, might be longer or shorter depending on your needs. After the treatment I'll tell you what I perceived and what to do to keep your energies healthy and balanced.
