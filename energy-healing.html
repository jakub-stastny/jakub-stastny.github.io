      <p>
        Energy healing is a powerful way of healing emotional, mental, spiritual and physical issues. It can even detect physical diseases up to several months before they manifest in body, since the body manifests from our energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many methods of energy work. I don't subscribe to any one of them. Methods are just fancy marketing terms, you either learnt to work energy or you didn't, simple as that.
      </p>

      <p>
        My healing abilities come from life-long sensibility and awareness, growing up in the countryside among plants and animals, later moving to the big world, forgetting all about my sensibilities and being constantly depressed, up to finally crashing to the point of not being able to tolerate my existence anymore, reborning and opening myself spiritually and knowing things from the future, talking to dead souls etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        So no, I haven't gone to a 3 week retreat for rich kids to learn healing in an ivory tower, the resources I have come from me. I'm eternally grateful to my spiritually advanced friends to guide through this period of my life.

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        Since I move about, I don't keep a permanent office(?) in any single place. We can either go to your place or outside: beach, medow, park, any quiet, high vibrating place. Just <a href="/contact">book a session</a>.
