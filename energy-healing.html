        <h2>How do I work?</h2>
        <p>
          Energy healing is a powerful way of healing emotional, mental, spiritual and physical issues. It can even detect physical diseases up to several months before they manifest in body, since the body manifests from our energy.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many methods of energy work. I don't subscribe to any one of them. Methods are just fancy marketing terms, you either learnt to work energy or you didn't, simple as that.
        </p>

        <p>
          My healing abilities come from life-long sensibility and awareness, growing up in the countryside among plants and animals, later moving to the big world, forgetting all about my sensibilities and being constantly depressed, up to finally crashing to the point of not being able to tolerate my existence anymore, reborning and opening myself spiritually and knowing things from the future, talking to dead souls etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          So no, I haven't gone to a 3 week retreat for rich kids to learn healing in an ivory tower, the resources I have come from me. I'm eternally grateful to my spiritually advanced friends to guide through this period of my life.
        </p>

        <h2>How does my session look like?</h2>
        <!-- Home/workplace visit is the proper term says Patricia. -->
        <p>
          After you book a session and I answer any questions you might have, I come to your place. I will ask you to lie down on your bed, I put a blanket over you, on top of which I put healing crystals, depending on which chakras you need strenghtening.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I play relaxating music, while I cleanse and seal the space. After we're in a safe and protected environment, I'll start aligning your aura and your chakras.
        </p>

        <p>
          The whole treatment takes about 40 minutes, might be longer or shorter depending on your needs. After the treatment I'll tell you what I perceived and what to do to keep your energies healthy and balanced.
        </p>
