      <h1>Astrology reading</h1>
      <p>
        I offer answering any question that can be reasonably answered by astrology for free. At the moment I don't offer whole chart readings.
      </p>

      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   As of now, I don't do whole chart readings, but I'm happy to answer -->
      <!--   any particular question you might have from your chart, such as -->
      <!--   questions about your career and relationships. -->
      <!-- </p> -->

      <p>
        I use primarily Vedic astrology, but with some additions,
        like the outer planets, certain Western astrology
        aspects and when needed, asteroids like Chiron.

      <p>
        If you'd like me to read your birth chart,
        please send me your date and place of birth.
        The exact hour of birth is very important.
