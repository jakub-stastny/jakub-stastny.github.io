      <h1>Astrology reading</h1>
      <p>
        I offer answering any question that can be reasonably answered by astrology for free. At the moment I don't offer whole chart readings.
      </p>


      <p>
        I use primarily Vedic astrology, but with some additions,
        like the outer planets, certain Western astrology
        aspects and when needed, asteroids like Chiron.

      <!-- of birth * your place of birth -->

      <!-- Tip jar. Explain the price on the site, it's a life of service, -->
      <!-- but please consider that I too have to eat (abbr.title no, I'm not -->

      <p>
        I believe doing good work in the world is more important than money.
        If you want to appreciate my work monetarily, you can

      <p>
        As of now, I don't do whole chart readings, but I'm happy to answer
        any particular question you might have from your chart, such as
        questions about your career and relationships.
      </p>

      <!--
        Enable once I'm qualified enough for whole chart readings.
      <p>
        If you'd like me to read your birth chart,
        please send me your date and place of birth.
        The exact hour of birth is very important.
        My contact is on the <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.
