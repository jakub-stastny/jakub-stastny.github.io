        ## The healing process

        What I call the Path is essentially what Joseph Campbell named hero's journey and what's been told by myths, stories and fairy tales for as long as humankind exists.

        Applied to an individual life of a modern man, this oftentimes is I couldn't take the suffering anymore, I decided to make changes in my life, I started tetting to know myself, I saw Light, but I was still confused, until something changed and I was the Light. I came back renewed and ready to finally live as well as to spread the wisdom I have found in the Light.

        What is it that needs to happen is to stop believing you are your mind.
        Everyone initially identifies with the train of thoughts in their head.
        Reducing the thoughts through meditations and other techniques can be
        frightening initially, I even thought there's something seriously wrong
        with me and that I might be dying.

        Once you're able to dis-entangle your real Self from the mind, you'll see that you haven't lost anything at all: on the contrary.

        ## Living in the Light

        This is the easy bit and those who live in the Light need no guides on how to do it. It simply is. I write this only to show how live is meant to be lived and what could be once the healing is finished.
