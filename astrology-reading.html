      <h1>Astrology reading</h1>
      <p>
        I use primarily Vedic astrology, but with some additions,
        like the outer planets, certain Western astrology
        aspects and when needed, asteroids like Chiron.
      </p>

      <!-- Extract out? about.html, .question -->
      <p style="color: dimgrey; font-style: italic;">
        I offer answering any question that can be reasonably answered by astrology for free. At the moment I don't offer whole chart readings.
      </p>

      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   As of now, I don't do whole chart readings, but I'm happy to answer -->
      <!--   any particular question you might have from your chart, such as -->
      <!--   questions about your career and relationships. -->
      <!-- </p> -->

      <h2>What astrology can answer</h2>
      <p>
      </p>

      <h2>What astrology can't or shouldn't answer</h2>
      <p>
      </p>

      <h2>What I need for a reading?</h2>
      <!-- <ul> -->
      <!--   <li>Your date and time of birth. Please indicate if the time could be imprecisse.</li> -->
      <!--   <li>Your place of birth.</li> -->
      <!-- </ul> -->

      <p>
        If you'd like me to answer your question based on your birth chart,
        please send me your date and place of birth.
        The exact hour of birth is very important.
      </p>

      <p>
        I realise these are sensitive details, but on the other hand <em>I do not need to know your name</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please do not send me screenshots of the chart as it may be using different zodiac, house system, not have outer planets etc or I might need to look at divisional charts. Just give me the data and I'll take care of getting the chart I want.
