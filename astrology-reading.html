      <h1>Astrology reading</h1>
      <p class="summary">
        I&nbsp;offer answering any question that can be reasonably answered by astrology for free.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&nbsp;use primarily Vedic astrology, but with some additions,
        like the&nbsp;outer planets, certain Western astrology
        aspects and when needed, asteroids like Chiron.
      </p>
      <!-- <p> -->
      <!--   As of now, I&nbsp;don't do whole chart readings, but I'm happy to answer -->
      <!--   any particular question you might have from your chart, such as -->
      <!--   questions about your career and relationships. -->
      <!-- </p> -->

      <h2>How can astrology be useful</h2>
      <p>
        Astrology helps you to understand yourself better.
        Any question that helps you do that is a&nbsp;good question.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the&nbsp;contrary questions that just want to know the&nbsp;future are pointless. "I&nbsp;just need to know" is an obsessive thought and leads you nowhere, but to waste your time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not to mention that the&nbsp;future is not fixed.
        We're in a&nbsp;process of co-creation.
        Parts of the&nbsp;energies are given, these are the&nbsp;ones astrology can tell you about.
        But what you do with these is up to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        These "empty" questions include when and who do you marry. You should instead try to understand what kind of partner complements you best and what are your subconscious issues that prevent you from having a&nbsp;healthy relationship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another one is "will I get a job?".
        You shouldn't be concerned with a job, you should be trying to figure out what is it that you really want to spend your life on and how to get there.
      </p>

      <p>
        So even though we can't do just about anything and free will absolutely does have its limitations, still, fatalistic approach is unhelpful.
        The question isn't "what awaits me", but rather how can I work with these energies that are already showing in my chart in order to become who I'm meant to be.
      </p>

      <h2>What I&nbsp;need for a&nbsp;reading?</h2>
      <p>
        I need your <strong>date, time and place of birth</strong>.
        The exact time of birth is very important.
        Please indicate if you're unsure about the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&nbsp;realise these are sensitive details, but on the&nbsp;other hand <em>I do not need to know your name</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please do not send me screenshots of the&nbsp;chart as it may be using different zodiac, house system, not have outer planets etc or I&nbsp;might need to look at divisional charts. Just give me the&nbsp;data and I'll take care of getting the&nbsp;chart I&nbsp;want.
