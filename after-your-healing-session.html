        <h1>After your session</h1>
        <p>
          First of all, thank you for allowing me to be healing you. It's always an honour and responsibility that I never take lightly.
        </p>

        </p>
          Now let's look at some things you can do for yourself to really take the best advantage of your session and to strengthen your commitment to your spiritual, mental and physical health:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>In the next 24 hours <b>drink plenty of water</b>, preferably either clear water or as apropriate tea. This will facilitate further cleansing of enegies that got unstuck during the session.</li>
          <li>If you can, <b>take it easy today</b>. Relaxing, reflecting, walk in the nature are all apropriate activities. Crazy party in San Pedro is not!</li>
          <li>Since I move a lot of energy in you, in some cases you might feel worse before you'll feel better. If it happens, don't be alarmed and don't hesitate to contact me. Remember that I'm here for you.</li>
          <li><b>Repeated sessions</b> are recommended if you have the time. They are also cheaper!</li>
          <li>I'm always <a style="font-weight: bold" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wA6c_2AdcuRVXRGFmr4fGWJhhVFo3nUgoNrd7Yj2hAA/edit?usp=sharing">looking for feedback</a>! That is, I'm interested in honest feedback in order to know what could I improve. Pat on the shoulder feels nice, but that's not the point here.</li>
        </ul>
