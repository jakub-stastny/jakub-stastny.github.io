        <h1>Energy healing</h1>

        <h2>How do I work?</h2>
        <p>
          Energy healing is a powerful way of healing emotional, mental, spiritual and physical issues. It can even detect physical diseases up to several months before they manifest in body, since the body manifests from our energy.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many methods of energy work. I don't subscribe to any one of them. Methods are just fancy marketing terms, you either learnt to work energy or you didn't, simple as that.
        </p>

        <p>
          My healing abilities come from life-long sensibility and awareness, growing up in the countryside among plants and animals, later moving to the big world, forgetting all about my sensibilities and being constantly depressed, up to finally crashing to the point of not being able to tolerate my existence anymore, reborning and opening myself spiritually and knowing things from the future, talking to dead souls etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          So no, I haven't gone to a 3 week retreat for rich kids to learn healing in an ivory tower, the resources I have come from me. I'm eternally grateful to my spiritually advanced friends to guide through this period of my life.
        </p>

        <h2>How does my session look like?</h2>
        <!-- Home/workplace visit is the proper term says Patricia. -->
        <p>
          After you book a session and I answer any questions you might have, I come to your place. I will ask you to lie down on your bed, I put a blanket over you, on top of which I put healing crystals, depending on which chakras you need strenghtening.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I play relaxating music, while I cleanse and seal the space and your aura. After we're in a safe and protected environment, I'll start aligning your aura and your chakras.
        </p>

        <p>
          The whole treatment takes about 40 minutes, might be longer or shorter depending on your needs. After the treatment I'll tell you what I perceived and what to do to keep your energies healthy and balanced.
        </p>

        <p>
          The protection I'll put on you will protect you your whole life against attacks and possesions by negative energies, which is priceless if you're a sensitive person and hence susceptible to psychic attacks from other people as well as other astral beings.
        </p>

              Jakub is well-prepared and above all very human in his approach. He puts attention to the client first.

              Before getting to know Jakub, I was nervous and stressed carrying so many issues from my daily life, but after receiving my session I felt really different: so relaxed and calm.

              Jakub is an excelent healer, very much recommended!

              Initially I was sceptical, but after I got to know Jakub, I decided to give it a go. He explained to me I need to connect more with nature (note: and life itself, to compensate underdevelopped 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> chakra) and not to only live in my head, amongst other things. His words really resonated with me and as I started to live by them, I started to feel better in my body, with less headaches and I felt my spine released a lot of tension, making me feel more relaxed. I highly recommend Jakub's therapy, both the therapy itself which was very powerful and quite frankly made me astonished as I wasn't aware previously how strong energy really is, as well as listening to his words, his message might be simple, but it's very powerful and efficient nonetheless.

              I felt like a huge release of energy from my shoulders, and shortly after I started crying for no specific reason. It was very strong and very liberating. Just thought I'd share this with you.
