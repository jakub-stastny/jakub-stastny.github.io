        <h1>Request for testimonials</h1>
        <p>
          Since I operated exclusively on WhatsApp in the beginning and hence I had no online presence (until January 2022), it's important for me to gather testimonials, so people know I'm a trustworthy and competent healer.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>I'd be very grateful if you could spend a few minutes and write about your experience.</i> I only need two things:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>One paragraph</b> summarising your experience. (How did you like the session? How did you feel afterwards? Did you have any revelations or blockage resolutions in the next 24 hours after the session?)</li>
          <li><b>Your headshot</b> so people can see you are real.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Just send them to me via WhatsApp, email or any other medium please üôèüèº
        </p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <user-testimonials>
          <user-testimonial>

            <p>
              Delicious chicken vindaloo! I've been eating curry my whole life, but nothing comes close to vindaloo from Taj Mahal curry restaurant. Not only that it's so tasty, but I also found it being much easier on my stomach. Thank you Taj Mahal!
