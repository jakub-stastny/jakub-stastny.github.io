      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p class="question">
        I'm dedicated to accompany and guide people in their healing journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is the biggest passion of my life, something far greater than either career, money or a&nbsp;label I&nbsp;can hang on the illusionary self.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some might think it's too good to be true. Obviously I&nbsp;could do other things in order to make more money, but I'm just not interested. I&nbsp;used to earn a&nbsp;lot of money while being disconnected, lonely and depressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I&nbsp;don't use money or social status as a&nbsp;criterion of success. I&nbsp;don't think about success at all actually. My motivation simply is inner fulfillment and a&nbsp;feeling of aliveness and Truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        And from this place of inner tranquility I&nbsp;feel compelled to help to spread peace, love and wisdom so others can live it too.
      </p>

      <p class="question">
        Ideals are great, but what do you eat? Or do you just have rich parents?
      </p>

      <p>
      I&nbsp;know from my own experience that when one follows his own <a href="/wiki/the-path">path in life</a>, he'll be given enough. I&nbsp;don't have rich parents and I'm not rich myself, but I&nbsp;always get what I&nbsp;need on my path, so there's no reason for me to worry.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's not to say I&nbsp;never work for money. Apart from accepting donations for energy healings I&nbsp;offer locally, I&nbsp;do various things that come my way such as cooking &amp; selling food or coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        One way or the other I'm no longer forced to sit in a&nbsp;cubicle and then having to drink in the evening in order to make myself forget that I'm wasting my life away. I&nbsp;love to cook and to code, so there's no inner contradiction. And I&nbsp;only say yes to work if I&nbsp;really mean it.
      </p>

      <p class="question">
        So then who are you really?
      </p>

      <p>
        Who am I&nbsp;as a&nbsp;person doesn't matter. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;conventional career, I&nbsp;had money and I&nbsp;travelled extensively. I'm neither a&nbsp;24 year old hippie untouched by real life nor a&nbsp;middle-aged depressed guy who lives in his mum's basement.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of struggles in my life until something within me changed and now I&nbsp;feel in peace, connected to all Life and there's nearly always a&nbsp;gentle underlaying joy as a&nbsp;background to my daily state of being, no matter what might be happening at the surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is essentially what I&nbsp;want to pass on: that the grief can end. That the pain can go away. No matter the life situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        And If you really want to know about me personally, feel free to ask me. I'm quite social when it comes to it.
      </p>

      <p class="question">
        How can you help?
      </p>

      <p>
        I&nbsp;had people commenting on my clarity and ability to see the bigger picture for as long as I&nbsp;remember.
      </p>

      <p>
        So when I&nbsp;started my journey towards a&nbsp;life of insight, everything finally clicked together.
        I&nbsp;realised this is something I&nbsp;not only like to do, but also something I'm actually really good at.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&nbsp;was fascinated by psychology and philosophy from a&nbsp;very young age. Over the years I learnt a&nbsp;lot about various subjects, particularly buddhism, taoism, Jung, therapy, psychology and astrology.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been offering energy healings locally and learnt a&nbsp;lot through that.
        I'm very sensitive to energy and I&nbsp;often receive guidance from the spiritual realm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again none of these really matter. My own mentor knows quite little about various philosophies for instance, yet she's the most remarkable being I've ever known.
      </p>

      <p>
        It does make people comfortable though, hence the list.
        Really the only credential that's required is <em>I&nbsp;am</em>.
        That might not make any sense in the beginning, but eventually it makes all the sense in the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&nbsp;believe the future of humanity is not lost and can be very bright, but we're at a&nbsp;critical stage when we must <a href="/wiki/transcending-the-mind">transcend our mind</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;or cease to exist as a&nbsp;species.
      </p>

      <p>
        My life is dedicated to help in this transition.
