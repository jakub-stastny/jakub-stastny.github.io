      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm dedicated to accompany and guide people in their healing journey and in bringing Light to their life. That for me is what makes my life worth living that's far more important that either career, money or a label I can hang on the illusionary self.

        Some might think it's too good to be true. Obviously I could do other things in order to make more money, but I'm just not interested. I used to earn a lot of money and be disconnected, lonely and depressed. So I don't use money or social status as a criterion of success, but rather inner fulfillment and feeling of aliveness and Truth.

        I know from my own experience that when one follows his own path in life, he'll be given enough. I don't have rich parents and I'm not rich myself, but I always get what I need on my path, so there's no reason to worry.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's not to say I never work for money. In my real life, I do energy healings and I accept donations for the work. When needed, I do various things that come my way such as cooking &amp; selling food or coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        One way or the other I'm no longer forced to sit in a cubicle and then having to drink in the evening in order to make myself forget that I'm wasting my life away. I love to cook and to code, so there's no inner contradiction.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had people commenting on my clarity and ability to see the bigger picture for as far as I remember. So when when I started with my journey towards a life of insight, everything clicked together.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe the future of humanity is not lost and can be very bright, but we're at a critical stage when we must transcend our mind â€“ or cease to exist as a species.

        My life is dedicated to helping in <a href="/wiki/transcending-the-mind">this transition</a>.
