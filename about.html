      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm dedicated to offering people help in their healing journey and bringing Light to their life. That for me is what makes my life worth living that's far important that either career and money or a label I can hang on the illusionary self.
      </p>

      <p>
        For most parts I try to stay offline and connect with my local community. However due to current circumstances I'm unable to do so (pending migratory status), so for the time being I decided to focus my efforts online.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe the future of humanity is not lost and can be very bright, but we're at a critical stage when we must transcend our mind – or cease to exist as a species.
      </p>

      <p>
        My life is dedicated to helping in <a href="/wiki/transcending-the-mind">this transition</a>.
