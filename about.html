      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p class="question">
        I'm dedicated to accompany and guide people in their healing journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is the biggest passion of my life, something far greater than either career, money or a label I can hang on the illusionary self.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some might think it's too good to be true. Obviously I could do other things in order to make more money, but I'm just not interested. I used to earn a lot of money while being disconnected, lonely and depressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I don't use money or social status as a criterion of success. I don't think about success at all actually. My motivation simply is inner fulfillment and a feeling of aliveness and Truth.
      </p>

      <p class="question">
        Ideals are great, but what do you eat? Or do you just have rich parents?
      </p>

      <p>
      I know from my own experience that when one follows his own <a href="/wiki/the-path">path in life</a>, he'll be given enough. I don't have rich parents and I'm not rich myself, but I always get what I need on my path, so there's no reason for me to worry.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's not to say I never work for money. In my real life, I do energy healings and I accept donations for the work. When needed, I do various things that come my way such as cooking &amp; selling food or coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        One way or the other I'm no longer forced to sit in a cubicle and then having to drink in the evening in order to make myself forget that I'm wasting my life away. I love to cook and to code, so there's no inner contradiction.
      </p>

      <p class="question">
        So then who are you really?
      </p>

      <p>
        Who I am as a person doesn't matter. I had a conventional career, I had money and I travelled extensively. So I'm neither a 24 yo hippie untouched by real life nor a middle-aged depressed guy without a job living in his mum's basement.
        <!-- But neither that is the point, the point is to offer help and resources to those who need and want it. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        I had a lot of struggles in my life until something within me changed and now I feel in peace, connected to all Life and there's nearly always a gentle underlaying joy as a background to my daily state of being.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is essentially what I want to pass on: that the grief can end. That the pain can go away. No matter the life situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you really want to know about me personally, feel free to ask me. I'm quite social when it comes to it.
      </p>

      <p class="question">
        How can you help?
      </p>

      <p>
        I had people commenting on my clarity and ability to see the bigger picture for as long as I remember. So when I started with my journey towards a life of insight, everything clicked together.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe the future of humanity is not lost and can be very bright, but we're at a critical stage when we must <a href="/wiki/transcending-the-mind">transcend our mind</a> â€“ or cease to exist as a species.
      </p>

      <p>
        My life is dedicated to help in this transition.
