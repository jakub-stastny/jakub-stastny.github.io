      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm dedicated to guiding people in their healing journey and bringing Light to their life. That for me is what makes my life worth living that's far more important that either career, money or a label I can hang on the illusionary self.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some might think it's too good to be true. Obviously I could do other things in order to make more money, but I'm just not interested. I used to earn a lot of money and be disconnected, lonely and depressed. I don't use money or social status as a criterion of success, but rather inner fulfillment.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know from experience that when one follows his own path in life, he'll be given enough. I don't have rich parents and I'm not rich myself, but I always get what I need on my path, so there's no reason to worry.
      </p>

      <p>
        For most parts I try to stay offline and connect with my local community. However due to current circumstances I'm unable to do so (pending migratory status), so for the time being I decided to focus my efforts online.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe the future of humanity is not lost and can be very bright, but we're at a critical stage when we must transcend our mind â€“ or cease to exist as a species.
      </p>

      <p>
        My life is dedicated to helping in <a href="/wiki/transcending-the-mind">this transition</a>.
